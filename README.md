`iofogctl` is a CLI for the installation, configuration, and operation of ioFog Edge Compute Networks (ECNs).

### Autocomplete

If you are running BASH or ZSH, iofogctl comes with shell autocompletion scripts.
In order to generate those scripts, run:

```bash
iofogctl autocomplete bash
```
OR

```bash
iofogctl autocomplete zsh
```

Then follow the instructions output by the command.

Example:
```bash
$> iofogctl autocomplete bash
âœ” $HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh generated
Run `source $HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh` to update your current session
Add `source $HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh` to your bash profile to have it saved

$>source $HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh
$>echo "$HOME/.iofog/completion.bash.sh" >> $HOME/.bash_profile
```

## Build from Source

This project uses go modules so it must be built from outside of your $GOPATH.

Go 1.12.1+ is a prerequisite. Install all other dependancies with:
```
script/bootstrap.sh
```

See all `make` commands by running:
```
make help
```

To build and install, go ahead and run:
```
make all
iofogctl --help
```

iofogctl is installed in `/usr/local/bin`

## Running Tests

Run project unit tests:
```
make test
```

This will output a JUnit compatible file into `reports/TEST-iofogctl.xml` that can be imported in most CI systems.
